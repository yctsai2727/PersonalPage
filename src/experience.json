It is known that a wide range of technique in the probabilistic model checking can be modified and translated into the quantum setting, but it is currently lacking a general framework for guiding such translation. Hence the goal of the project is to develop a categorical framework that unifies the approach for formulating and verifying various models in the probabilistic and quantum setting, in the same time we also looking for opportunities to develop algorithms and tools for quantum model checking based on the theorem developed."

I mainly worked in the field of formal methods and model checking but also kept an eyes on the application of parameterized algorithm for improving the solutions. Our #h{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3622868}{recent work} improved the existing algebraic program analysis (APA) framework and provided an efficient extension to the on-demand setting."

Various approaches like Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), clustering methods, and trajectory analysis have been studied and we proposed a new quantity for capturing LCS in a recent paper submitted to CiCP. Recently we are looking into the stochastic extension of our proposed framework and working around both the optimization of the method and analysis on different test cases."

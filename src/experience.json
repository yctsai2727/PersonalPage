The project is still in progress."

I mainly worked in the field of formal methods and model checking but also kept an eyes on the application of parameterized algorithm for improving the solutions. Our #h{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3622868}{recent work} improved the existing algebraic program analysis (APA) framework and provided an efficient extension to the on-demand setting. A recent focus of my research direction in this group focuses on the probabilistic program analysis and the application of martingale theory, variuous problems like the methods of synthesizing martingales and alternative extension of APA framework using martingale theory are currently the main direction of study."

Various approaches like Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), clustering methods, and trajectory analysis have been studied and we proposed a new quantity for capturing LCS in a recent paper submitted to CiCP. Recently we are looking into the stochastic extension of our proposed framework and working around both the optimization of the method and analysis on different test cases."
